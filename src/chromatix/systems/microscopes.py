class Microscope(nn.Module):
    """
    Microscope with a planewise spatially invariant point spread function.

    This ``Microscope`` is a ``flax`` ``Module`` that accepts a function
    or ``Module`` that computes the point spread function (PSF) of the
    microscope. ``Microscope`` then uses this PSF to simulate imaging via a
    convolution of the sample with the specified PSF. Optionally, the sensor
    can also simulate noise. Parameters of the provided PSF are allowed to be
    trainable (using ``chromatix.utils.trainable``), e.g. the phase mask of the
    Optical4FSystemPSF.

    Attributes:
        system_psf: A function or ``Module`` that will compute the field at the
            sensor plane due to a point source for this imaging system. Must
            take a ``Microscope`` as the first argument to read any relevant
            optical properties of the system. Can take any other arguments
            passed during a call to this ``Microscope`` (e.g. z values to
            compute a 3D PSF at for imaging). Can either return a ``Field``, in
            which case the intensity and spacing of the PSF will automatically
            be determined, or an ``Array``, in which case the ``Array`` is
            assumed to be the intensity and the spacing of the PSF will be
            automatically determined based on the ratio of the specified
            ``sensor_shape`` to the shape of the PSF.
        sensor_shape: A tuple of form (H W) defining the camera sensor shape.
        sensor_spacing: A float defining the pixel pitch of the camera sensor.
        f: Focal length of the system's objective.
        n: Refractive index of the system's objective.
        NA: The numerical aperture of the system's objective.
        spectrum: The wavelengths included in the simulation of the system's
            PSF.
        spectral_density: The weights of each wavelength in the simulation of
            the system's PSF.
        padding_ratio: The proportion of the original PSF shape that will be
            added to simulate the PSF. That means the final shape will be shape
            * (1.0 + padding) in each dimension. This will then automatically
            be cropped to the original desired shape after simulation. Defaults
            to None, in which case no cropping occurs.
        taper_width: The width in pixels of the sigmoid that will be used to
            smoothly bring the edges of the PSF to 0. This helps to prevent
            edge artifacts in the image if the PSF has edge artifacts. Defaults
            to None, in which case no tapering is applied.
        shot_noise_mode: A string of either 'approximate' or 'poisson' that
            determines how to add noise to the image. Defaults to None, in
            which case no noise is applied.
        psf_resampling_method: A string of either 'linear' or 'cubic' that
            determines how the PSF is resampled to the shape of the sensor.
            Note that this assumes that the PSF that is computed has the same
            field of view as the sensor.
        reduce_axis: If provided, the input will be summed along this
            dimension.
        reduce_parallel_axis_name: If provided, psum along the axis with this
            name.
