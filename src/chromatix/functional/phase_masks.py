    Computes the "defocused ramps" phase mask as described in [1].

    This phase mask is intended to be used in a 4f microscope to produce a

    multiple subimages of the sample on the camera that are projections of the
    sample along different angles and through different axial ranges, intended
    to be used for 3D snapshot microscopy.

    The name describes the fact that the phase mask consists of multiple phase
    ramps around a central flat region, combined with a bowl of defocus within
    each phase ramp to defocus the pencil beam that results from that arm of
    the phase mask.
