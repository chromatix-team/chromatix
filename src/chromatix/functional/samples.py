    ``VectorField``. Ignores the incoming field in z direction.

    sample perturbation is calculated for each component in the Jones matrix as:
    ``exp(1j * 2 * pi * (dn + 1j * absorption) * thickness / lambda)`` where dn
    and absorption are allowed to vary per component of the Jones matrix, but
    thickness is assumed to be the same for each component of the Jones matrix.

    Returns a ``VectorField`` with the result of the perturbation.
