    """
    Perturbs a ``field`` as if it went through a thin sample object with a given
    ``absorption`` and refractive index change ``dn`` and of a given
    ``thickness`` in micrometres.

    The sample is supposed to follow the thin sample approximation, so the sample
    perturbation is calculated as
    ``exp(1j * 2*pi * (dn + 1j*absorption) * thickness / lambda)``.

    Returns a ``Field`` with the result of the perturbation.

    Args:
        field: The complex field to be perturbed.
        absorption: The sample absorption per micrometre defined as [B H W C] array
        dn: sample refractive index change [B H W C] array
        thickness: thickness at each sample location [B H W C] array
