    Perturbs a ``field`` as if it went through a thin sample object with a given

    The Jones matrix Suppose that a monochromatic plane wave of light is travelling
    in the positive z-direction, with angular frequency Ï‰ and wave vector k = (0,0,k),
    where k = 2pi/wavelength. We ignore the incoming field in z direction.

    The sample is supposed to follow the thin sample approximation, so the sample
    perturbation is calculated for each component in Jones Matrix
    ``exp(1j * 2*pi * (dn + 1j*absorption) * thickness / lambda)``.

    Returns a ``Field`` containing x y component with the result of the perturbation.

        field: The complex field to be perturbed.
        absorption: The sample absorption per micrometre defined as [B 2 2 H W C] array
