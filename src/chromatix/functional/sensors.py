    Produces an intensity image from an incoming ``Field`` with shot noise.

    Attributes:
        shape: The shape in pixels of the sensor. Should be of the form (H W).
        spacing: The pitch of the sensor pixels.
        shot_noise_mode: What type of shot noise simulation to use. Defaults to
            None, in which case no shot noise is simulated.
        resample: If provided, will be called to resample the incoming
            ``Field`` to the given ``shape``.
        reduce_axis: If provided, the result will be summed along this
