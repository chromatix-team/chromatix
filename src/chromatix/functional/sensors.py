    Produces an intensity image from an incoming ``Field`` or intensity
    ``Array`` and simulates shot noise.

    Args:
        sensor_input: Either the incoming ``Field`` or an intensity ``Array`` to
            be sampled by the sensor with shot noise.
        shot_noise_mode: What type of shot noise simulation to use. Can be
            either "approximate", "poisson", or None. Defaults to None, in which
            case no shot noise is simulated (the sensor is perfect).
        resample_fn: If provided, will be called to resample the incoming
            ``Field`` to the given ``shape``.
        reduce_axis: If provided, the result will be summed along this
            dimension.
        reduce_parallel_axis_name: If provided, psum along the axis with this
            name.
        input_spacing: Only needs to be provided if ``sensor_input`` is an
            intensity ``Array`` and not a ``Field``. If provided, defines the
            spacing of the input to be used for resampling by the sensor.
        noise_key: If provided, will be used to generate the shot noise.
