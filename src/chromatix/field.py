class Field(struct.PyTreeNode):
    """
    A container that describes the chromatic scalar light field at a 2D plane.

    ``Field`` objects track various attributes of a complex-valued scalar
    field (in addition to the field itself for each wavelength): the spacing
    of the samples along the field, the wavelengths in the spectrum, and the
    density of the wavelengths. This information can be used, for example, to
    calculate the intensity of a field at a plane, appropriately weighted by
    the spectrum. ``Field`` objects also provide various grids for convenience,
    as well as allow elementwise operations with any broadcastable values,
    including scalars, arrays, or other ``Field`` objects. These operations
    include: `+`, `-` (including negation), `*`, `/`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`.

    The shape of a base ``Field`` object is `[B H W C]`, where B is batch,
    H and W are height and width, and C is the channel dimension, which
    we use for different wavelengths in the spectrum of a ``Field``. The
    batch dimension can be used for any purpose, such as different samples,
    depth, or time. If more dimensions are required, we encourage the use of
    ``jax.vmap``, ``jax.pmap``, or a combination of the two. We intend for this
    to be a compromise between not having too many dimensions when they are
    not required, and also not having to litter a program with ``jax.vmap``
    transformations for common simulations in 3D.

    Concretely, this means simulations that are only in 2D and with a single
    wavelength will always have only two distinct singleton dimensions. Any
    simulations taking into account either depth or multiple wavelengths will
    not need to use JAX transformations or loops. Any simulations requiring
    both 3D spatial dimensions and the tracking of the field across time will
    either have to loop through time or use ``jax.vmap``/``jax.pmap``.

    Due to this shape, in order to ensure that attributes of ``Field``
    objects broadcast appropriately, attributes which could be 1D arrays
    are ensured to have extra singleton dimensions. In order to make the
    creation of a ``Field`` object more convenient, we provide the class
    method ``Field.create()`` (detailed below), which accepts scalar or 1D
    array arguments for the various attributes (e.g. if a single wavelength
    is desired, a scalar value can be used, but if multiple wavelengths are
    desired, a 1D array can be used for the value of ``spectrum``). This method
    appropriately reshapes the attributes provided to the correct shapes.

    Attributes:
        u: The scalar field of shape `[B H W C]`.
        dx: The spacing of the samples in ``u`` discretizing a continuous field.
        spectrum: The wavelengths sampled by the field, in any units specified.
        spectral_density: The weights of the wavelengths in the spectrum. Must
            sum to 1.0.
