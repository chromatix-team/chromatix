class Field(struct.PyTreeNode):
    """
    A container that describes the chromatic light field at a 2D plane.

    ``Field`` objects track various attributes of a complex-valued field (in
    addition to the field itself for each wavelength): the spacing of the
    samples along the field, the wavelengths in the spectrum, and the density
    of the wavelengths. This information can be used, for example, to calculate
    the intensity of a field at a plane, appropriately weighted by the spectrum.
    ``Field`` objects also provide various grids for convenience, as well
    as allow elementwise operations with any broadcastable values, including
    scalars, arrays, or other ``Field`` objects. These operations include: `+`,
    `-` (including negation), `*`, `/`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`.

    The shape of a ``Field`` object is `(B... H W C [1 | 3])`, where B... is
    an arbitrary number of batch dimensions, H and W are height and width,
    and C is the channel dimension, which we use for different wavelengths in
    the spectrum of a ``Field``. The final dimension has size either 1 for a
    scalar approximation ``ScalarField`` or 3 for the full vectorial case of
    ``VectorField``. Any function in Chromatix that deals with ``Field``s can
    work with either ``ScalarField``s or ``VectorField``s, unless otherwise
    stated.

    The (potentially more than 1) batch dimensions can be used for any purpose,
    such as different samples, depth, or time. Any Chromatix functions that
    produce multiple depths (e.g. propagation to multiple z values) will
    broadcast to the innermost batch dimension. If more dimensions are required,
    we encourage the use of ``jax.vmap``, ``jax.pmap``, or a combination of
    the two. We intend for this to be a compromise between not having too many
    dimensions when they are not required, and also not having to litter a
    program with ``jax.vmap`` transformations for common simulations in 3D or 3D
    over time.

    Due to this shape, in order to ensure that attributes of ``Field``
    objects broadcast appropriately, attributes which could be 1D arrays are
    ensured to have extra singleton dimensions. In order to make the creation
    of ``Field`` objects more convenient, we provide the class methods
    ``ScalarField.create()`` and ``VectorField.create()`` (detailed below),
    which accepts scalar or 1D array arguments for the various attributes
    (e.g. if a single wavelength is desired, a scalar value can be used, but if
    multiple wavelengths are desired, a 1D array can be used for the value of
    ``spectrum``). These methods appropriately reshapes the attributes provided
    to the correct shapes.

    Attributes:
        u: The complex field of shape ``(B... H W C [1 | 3])``.
        _dx: The spacing of the samples in ``u`` discretizing a continuous
            field. Defined as a 2D array of shape ``(2 C)`` specifying the spacing
            in the y and x directions respectively (can be the same for y and
            x for the common case of square pixels). Spacing is the same per
            wavelength for all entries in a batch. Not intended to be publicly
            accessed, because the shape of this attribute does not dynamically
            adapt to the ``ndim`` of the ``Field``. Instead, use the ``dx``
            property.
        _spectrum: The wavelengths sampled by the field, in any units specified.
            Should be a 1D array. Not intended to be publicly accessed, because
            the shape of this attribute does not dynamically adapt to the
            ``ndim`` of the ``Field``. Instead, use the ``spectrum`` property.
        _spectral_density: The weights of the wavelengths in the spectrum.
            Shouldbe a 1D array of same length as ``_spectrum``. Must sum to
            1.0. Not intended to be publicly accessed, because the shape of
            this attribute does not dynamically adapt to the ``ndim`` of the
            ``Field``. Instead, use the ``spectral_density`` property.
