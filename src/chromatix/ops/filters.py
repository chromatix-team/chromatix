    Performs a high pass filter on ``data``.

    The high pass filter is constructed as the difference between a
    delta kernel and a Gaussian kernel with standard deviation ``sigma``.

    Args:
        data: The input to be high pass filtered.
        sigma: The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel, which sets the
            low pass filter. The result of this low pass will be subtracted
            from the input.
        kernel_shape: The shape of the kernel. If not provided, the shape will
            be determined by the required shape of a Gaussian kernel truncated
            to ``4.0 * sigma``.
