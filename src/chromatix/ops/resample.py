            and width) for downsampling along `(H W)`.

    Returns a function that resamples 2D planes to the specified output shape
    and spacing.

    The returned function is allowed to be jitted because the shape of the
    output will no longer depend on the input of this function.

    Multiple ``resampling_methods`` are supported: either `'pooling'` which
    uses sum pooling (for downsampling only) or any method supported by
    ``jax.image.scale_and_translate`` (`'linear'`, `'cubic'`, `'lanczos3'`,
    or `'lanczos5'`).

    The input may have any number of dimensions after the first two, but
    the returned function assumes that the 2D planes to be downsampled are
    contained in the first two axes. Any other dimensions are treated as batch
    dimensions, i.e. resampling is parallelized across those dimensions. In
    order to add arbitrary batch dimensions before the first two dimensions,
    use ``jax.vmap``.
