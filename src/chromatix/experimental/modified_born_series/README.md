# The Convergent Born Series Iteration in JAX

This is Chromatix' experimental implementation of the MBS, implemented in collaboration with Tom Vettenburg of macromax. It is fully functional, but still misses few features (see below). An example is in the `docs/examples` folder.


## TODO
- [ ] Change x-y-z ordering to z-y-x, inline with Chromatix.
- [ ] Add tensorial permittivities
- [ ] Add example on inverse design
- [ ] Take Chromatix `Field` as source, and return `Field`.
- [ ] Change Jaxopt optimiser to Optimistix
- [ ] Add Chiral and magnetic terms.
