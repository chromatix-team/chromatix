    Applies a ``phase`` mask to an incoming ``Field``.

    This element can be placed after any element that returns a ``Field`` or
    before any element that accepts a ``Field``.

    This element handles multi-wavelength ``Field``s by assuming that the first
    wavelength in the ``spectrum`` of the ``Field`` is the central wavelength
    for which the ``phase`` was calculated, and modulates the ``phase`` by the
    ratio of other wavelengths in the ``spectrum`` to the central wavelength
    appropriately.

    The ``phase`` can be learned (pixel by pixel) by using
    ``chromatix.utils.trainable``.

    Since phase mask initializations might require information about the
    pupil of a system, the extra parameters ``n``, ``f``, and ``NA`` can
    be specified. These will be passed as arguments to the phase mask
    initialization function if ``phase`` is trainable. Note that if any of
    these is None, none of them will be passed to the initialization function
    and you will get an error.

        Attributes:
        phase: The phase to be applied. Should have shape `(H W)`.
        f: Focal length of the system's objective. Defaults to None.

    Simulates a spatial light modulator (SLM) applied to an incoming ``Field``.

    This element can be placed after any element that returns a ``Field`` or
    before any element that accepts a ``Field``.

    This means that this element acts as if the SLM is phase only and transmits
    a ``Field``, rather than reflecting it.

    This element handles multi-wavelength ``Field``s by assuming that the first
    wavelength in the ``spectrum`` of the ``Field`` is the central wavelength
    for which the ``phase`` was calculated, and modulates the ``phase`` by the
    ratio of other wavelengths in the ``spectrum`` to the central wavelength
    appropriately.

    This element also handles the limited phase modulation range of an SLM,
    controlled by ``phase_range``.

    This element also roughly handles the simulation of the surface of
    the SLM by interpolating the phase with the given ``shape`` (which
    can be the number of pixels in the SLM) to the shape of the incoming
    ``Field``, which is assumed to have a shape larger than the given SLM
    ``shape``. The order of the interpolation performed can be controlled with
    ``interpolation_order``, but currently only orders of 0 (nearest neighbor)
    and 1 (linear interpolation) are supported.

    The ``phase`` of the SLM can be learned (pixel by pixel) by using
    ``chromatix.utils.trainable``.

    Attributes:
        phase: The phase to be applied. Should have shape `(H W)`.

            the shape of the incoming ``Field``. Can be 0 or 1. Defaults to 0.
