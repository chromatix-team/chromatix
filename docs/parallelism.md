# Parallelism

Chromatix is designed to be parallelized, both on a single device as well as
across multiple devices (e.g. multiple GPUs).

What this parallelism looks like is heavily application-dependent, so
`chromatix` does not enforce any particular mode of parallelism, but
is written with the potential for multiple kinds of parallelism through
[``jax.vmap``](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/
jax.vmap.html#jax.vmap), [``jax.pmap``](https://jax.readthedocs.io/
en/latest/_autosummary/jax.pmap.html#jax.pmap), and distributed
[``jax.Array``](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/
Distributed_arrays_and_automatic_parallelization.html?highlight=sharded).

We describe two major categories of parallelization here, and show some
examples of how specific simulations in `chromatix` might be parallelized.

The first category is explicit parallelization, where we directly specify along
which dimensions a computation will be parallelized. This is useful when we
have some knowledge about what parts of a simulation can be run independently,
and can actually be simpler to reason about and program than implicit
parallelization.

The second category is implicit parallelization across multiple devices,
which allows ``jax.jit`` to automatically parallelize a simulation and has the
advantage of allowing for functions to be written as if the computation were
being performed on a single device. However, this style of parallelization
can require some experimentation to choose the correct initial placement of
arrays across multiple devices so that ``jax.jit`` can choose the optimal
parallelization. Also, this is currently a new API in `jax` so up-to-date
documentation and support in other libraries (such as `flax`, which we depend
on) may be lacking.

## Explicit parallelization

A common style of parallelism is across a batch dimension. Chromatix already
describes ``Field`` objects with arbitrary batch dimensions, such that they
have a shape `(B... H W C [1 | 3])`. This means that across a single device,
any computations across the (potentially multiple) batch (`B`) and channel (`C`)
dimensions are already performed in parallel. It is possible to parallelize
additional dimensions using `jax.vmap` on a single device. For example, we can
look at the widefield PSF example from the README (but adjusted so that the
workload is large enough to observe some benefit from parallelization). Here is
the single device version:

```python
from chromatix.elements import ObjectivePointSource, PhaseMask, FFLens
from chromatix import OpticalSystem
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

shape = (1536, 1536) # number of pixels in simulated field
spacing = 0.3 # spacing of pixels for the final PSF, microns
spectrum = 0.532 # microns
spectral_density = 1.0
f = 100.0 # focal length, microns
n = 1.33 # refractive index of medium
NA = 0.8 # numerical aperture of objective
optical_model = OpticalSystem(
    [
        ObjectivePointSource(shape, spacing, spectrum, spectral_density, f, n, NA),
        PhaseMask(jnp.ones(shape)),
        FFLens(f, n),
    ]
)

@jax.jit
def compute_psf(z):
    return optical_model.apply({}, z).intensity


single_z = jnp.linspace(-4, 4, num=128)
widefield_psf = compute_psf(single_z)
```

This takes **25.06ms** to run on an NVIDIA A100 GPU (averaged over 10 runs, not
including the time to JIT compile the function).

We can explicitly parallelize on multiple devicess by running different chunks of
the batch dimension (which in this simulation represents depth) on different
devices, because we know each plane can be simulated independently. We can do this
using ``jax.pmap``:

```python
@jax.pmap
def compute_psf(z):
    return optical_model.apply({}, z).intensity


pmap_z = jnp.linspace(-4, 4, num=128).reshape(4, 32)
widefield_psf = compute_psf(pmap_z)
```

This takes **6.45ms** to run on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs (averaged over 10 runs). This
means we have scaled in speed almost linearly with the number of devices, which
makes sense because this computation is totally independent.

Note that we did not have to change anything in the definition of the optical
system in order to obtain this parallelization! We were able to simply
transform the function that computes the intensity and correspondingly change
how we pass the ``z`` values that we want to simulate. The point of the
reshaping is to allow ``jax.pmap`` to map the function ``compute_psf`` over
``z`` values in chunks of 32 across all 4 devices to simulate the same 128 planes
of the PSF.

Let's look at an example where the computation isn't completely independent
across multiple devices: simulating a PSF and then simulating imaging with this
PSF. We can also show how to do this when there are optimizable parameters that
must be initialized and passed in, instead of an empty parameter dictionary.
First, let's look at the single device version:

```python
from chromatix.systems import Microscope, Optical4FSystemPSF
from chromatix.elements import BasicShotNoiseSensor
from chromatix.utils import trainable
from chromatix.functional.phase_masks import flat_phase

microscope = Microscope(
    system_psf=Optical4FSystemPSF(
        shape=shape,
        spacing=spacing,
        phase=trainable(flat_phase)
    ),
    sensor=BasicShotNoiseSensor(
        shape=shape,
        spacing=spacing,
        resampling_method=None,
        reduce_axis=0
    ),
    f=f,
    n=n,
    NA=NA,
    spectrum=spectrum,
    spectral_density=spectral_density,
)

def init_params(key, volume, z):
    params = microscope.init(key, volume, z)
    return params

@jax.jit
def compute_image(params, volume, z):
    return microscope.apply(params, volume, z)

volume = jnp.ones((128, *shape, 1, 1)) # fill in your volume here
z = jnp.linspace(-4, 4, num=128)
params = init_params(jax.random.PRNGKey(6022), volume, z)
widefield_image = compute_image(params, volume, z)
```

Here, we constructed a ``Microscope`` with a 4f system PSF, but this time we
specified that the phase is a trainable parameter. This means that we have to
initialize the parameters for this ``flax.linen.Module`` and also pass these
parameters when we want to call the ``Microscope``. This ``Microscope`` also
accepted a ``BasicShotNoiseSensor`` with a ``reduce_axis`` argument, which we
have specified to sum across the batch dimension (axis 0) to simulate a camera
collecting light from multiple planes. This computation ran in **172.86ms** on a
single NVIDIA A100 GPU (average over 10 runs).

Just like last time, we can parallelize this to multiple devices along the
batch dimension by using ``jax.pmap``:

```python
from functools import partial

microscope = Microscope(
    system_psf=Optical4FSystemPSF(
        shape=shape,
        spacing=spacing,
        phase=trainable(flat_phase)
    ),
    sensor=BasicShotNoiseSensor(
        shape=shape,
        spacing=spacing,
        resampling_method=None,
        reduce_axis=0,
        reduce_parallel_axis_name="devices"
    ),
    f=f,
    n=n,
    NA=NA,
    spectrum=spectrum,
    spectral_density=spectral_density,
)

@partial(jax.pmap, axis_name='devices')
def init_params(key, volume, z):
    params = microscope.init(key, volume, z)
    return params

@partial(jax.pmap, axis_name='devices')
def compute_image(params, volume, z):
    return microscope.apply(params, volume, z)

volume = jnp.ones((128, *shape, 1, 1)).reshape(4, 32, *shape, 1, 1) # volume is chunked
z = jnp.linspace(-4, 4, num=128).reshape(4, 32) # z is chunked
params = init_params(jax.random.split(jax.random.PRNGKey(6022), 4), volume, z)
widefield_image = compute_image(params, volume, z)
```

This time, we ended up having to make a change to how we define the optics. That
is because each device first computes a partial image of just the chunk that it
received, which are summed across the batch dimension on each device (because we
specified ``reduce_axis``). So, we need to make sure that we are summing these
partial images together across all the devices. We can tell `jax` to do that by
using ``jax.lax.psum``, which happens internally in the ``BasicShotNoiseSensor``
because we specified ``reduce_parallel_axis_name`` in addition to
``reduce_axis``. Now, each device has a copy of the same final image.

That means that if we look at the shape of ``widefield_image``, we'll see that
it has shape `[4 1536 1536 1]` because we ran on 4 devices. Each of those 4
2D images is identical. However, because we computed these images in parallel,
this version ran in **51.71ms** on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs (average over 10 runs).
Because of the fact that we have to sum the image across all the devices, you
can see this computation does not scale as well (though is still many times
faster than the single device version).
 
## Implicit parallelization

Using [``jax.Array``](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/
Distributed_arrays_and_automatic_parallelization.html?highlight=sharded), it is
possible to have ``jax.jit`` handle the parallelism across multiple devices.

This requires that you specify how `jax` should split up any input arrays
across multiple devices (this is referred to as "sharding" an array). Then, any
function written as if for a single device will be automatically parallelized
across multiple devices when it is compiled through ``jax.jit`` with a sharded
input array.
